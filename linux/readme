All the dependency packages are initially included in "packages.json" file. 

Intially data is read from the file in key and value format i.e. key = packageName and value = version number.

Everytime the stdandard output is stored in stdout.txt. 

From the stdout we can now search for specified keywords in the stdout.file.
